Three words that best describe me:

 - Creative
 - Attentive
 - Broad-minded

 I love to travel. Ever since I was a kid, I loved being adventurous. I used to get on my bicycle and discover unknown areas of my city. Somehow, I never got lost.
 That is also one of the reasons I want to get into web development. Because the job is similar everywhere across the globe, I will be able to find work anywhere I go.
